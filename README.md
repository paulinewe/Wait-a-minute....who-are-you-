## Overview
This is a project on pattern separation of familiar and unfamiliar faces for a research course at Goethe-University of Frankfurt. We will transfer the Mnenomnic Similarity Task by Stark, Kirwan and Stark (2019) into an fMRI investigation using face stimuli. The aim is to further examine the participation of the hippocampus in pattern separation of faces and the involvement of other brain regions, as literature raises doubts if this process is limited to the hippocampus. The data will be collected in cooperation with Prof. Gyula Kovacs from Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, where the fMRI experiments will take place. Following that we will further analyse the process by training a articifical neuronal network work. 

The aim of the respository is to allow a transparent and replicable research project, by providing the codes, data and information on the process. This should enable fellow researchers to have a critically look,redo the experiment and analyses, as well as use the collected data for further research.

### Structure and content (in the future)
What you will find here:
- python code for experiment created in PsychoPy3
- set of familiar and unfamiliar faces used in experiment
- data (fmr, behavioral)
- python code artificial neuronal network

### Further ressources
The project is also published on OSF, where you can get further information and recent activities regarding the experiment and analyses as well as literature we based the experiment and analyses on.
