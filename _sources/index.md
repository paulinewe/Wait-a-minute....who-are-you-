Hello everyone and welcome to the page of my assignment.

## Whoru..

Within this website you can explore what I did and went through in the course 'Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience' and you can get an idea on how to work with neuro data in a open-sciency way as I introduce you to some open source ressources making life a bit easier (... well depends,ay?)

You can use the following sections to navigate through the content of the lecture:

* [Intro](./markdown/Intro.md)
* [Documentation](./markdown/Documentation.md)
* [BIDS-Conversion](./markdown/BIDS-Conversion.md)
* [Preprocessing](./markdown/Preprocessing.md)
* [Data Exploration](./code/Exploration.ipynb)
* [Neuroquery](./markdown/Neuroquery.md)
* [Results](/content/code/Brainmap.ipynb)
* [Discussion](./markdown/Discussion.md)
