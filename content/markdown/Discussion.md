# Discussion

In this capture I want to reflect on the results from my research project as well as the research process.

## Results

Unfourtunetly I could not work with a machine learning approach, nevthertheless due to Neuroquery I could at least provide an approximate answer validating the findings from the paper I based the research on. The most studies provided by Neuroquery point in the same direction as the results of the paper, indicating adaptation to facial identity and face-identity change effects in the FFA and the OFA, but not image-invariant adapation. On the other hand, those studies did not follow the same procedure as Rostalski et al. (2020), therefore the results are not completely compareable. Also the paper presented by Neuroquery are limited to the data set it was trained on, so newe data might not be involved by creating the literature list and the brain map.

With a bigger data set and more time and capacities a deeper look into the relevant brain structure and their connection to identity encoding and face recognition could have been provided. Especcially, as while reading through the literature, there is a huge variety on other brain structures related to face identity representations.

## Process

### Learnings

The research process and the seminar taught me a lot about good quality workflows and introduced me to  some useful tools to organize, update and  analyse ressources. Eventhough it was a 'small' project, I learned that it still needs a lot of time to get into the software tools, develop an idea, think throughh code, manage the tasks and how much time it takes to convert data into the BIDS-format. The conversion itself took long, because of computer capacitiesa and then I had to create the event files myself from the matlab files of the data set. But once it is in the write format, a world with tools making reaseach life a lot easier opens up. So using tools and standards that are easily acessible and understandable due high transparency, is really something researcher should strive for.

### Difficulties and throwbacks

My research process did not work out as I planned. My inital experiment had to be canceled, as time and capactity limits of the fMRI scanner would have resulted in a study with 10 participants max. Next downside is, that the data set I now used is not openly available, which limited my possibilites to work with it as my computer does not provide the capacitiey to run preprocessing and quality controll locally and uploading the data somewhere was not an option. 
The computer was one of the main problems, as I also lost a lot of time as programms like Docker sometimes did not work and as I first wanted to install everything for the conversion, I needed redo the whole set-up for Ubuntu, conda etc. That was connected to a lot of trail and error, as somehow the programmes did not cooperated. In the end I solved it, but it costed a loot of time.
