# Introduction 

So before we dive in to what about what my project is all about, here are some information on the context of the project and the background of this site. 

## The Course 'Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience' 

Psychology students in there masters degree at [University of Frankfurt](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/de?locale=de) take part in research internships as a part of there curriculum. As a student majoring in Cognitive Neuroscience, one could choose the course ['Cognitve and Computational Neuroscience: an introduction to machine/deep learning and neuro-data-science'](https://peerherholz.github.io/Cog_Com_Neuro_ML_DL/index.html). The goal of the course is to provide an understanding for research processes and practical tools to make research more sufficent, but also more transparent and enable replicability. All this is taught while introducing people to neuroscience and artificial intelligence. To get the most out of it, students are working on self-chosen experiements in which they apply their knowldege from the course. The course is/was taught and the projects were primarly supervised by [Michael Ernst](https://github.com/M-earnest) and [Peer Herholz](https://github.com/PeerHerholz).


## Whoru - My project

Whoru...is short for 'Whor are you' and that is kind of the theme for my project work.

I am quite interested in face recognition and initailly wanted to add an fMRI assessment based on my bachelor thesis on [pattern separation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_G7HCNG-bI) of familiar and unfamiliar faces in cooperation with [Prof. Dr. Gyula Kovács from the University of Jena](http://cogsci.uni-jena.de/team/team-subpage-kovacs/). Unfortunately, for time, capacitiy  and practical reasons I had to cancel that idea (one of the difficulties I encountered, [see here](./Discussion.md#difficulties-and-throwbacks)).

Prof. Kovács was so kind to give access to another data set, from a different study on face recognition and that is the one I worked on during the course. It took a bit of organisational and bureaucratic work to get the data set...

... and that guys, is the story on how I finally got a data set!
