##  Evaluation of Data Set

As mentioned in the [Intro](./Intro.md) I recieved my data from Prof. Dr. Gyula Kovács at University of Frankfurt. I was provided with access to there server to download the dataset.
Unfourtunately the raw data is not available freely, that's why I am can only present what is legally possible and therefore reproducing is limited. Nevertheless, extraced fMRI data and code from the originial study by Rostalski et al. (2022) is available at OSF (https://osf.io/m3pwt/). 

The data set consists of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans from a face recognition task for 30 participants. For scanning a three Tesla MR Scanner (Siemens Prisma fit) was used. Functional data was obtained using an Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) Sequence (35 slices; TR = 2000 ms; TE = 30 ms; flip angle = 90°; 64*64 matrices; in-plane resolution: 3 × 3 mm2; slice thickness: 3 mm).  and magnetisation-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence (MP-RAGE; TR = 2300 ms; TE = 3,03, 1 mm isotropic voxel size) was used to acquire high-resolution T1-weighted sagittal images for structual 3D images. All images they used a 20-channel head coil.
